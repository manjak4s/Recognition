CWAC-Camera: Taking Pictures. Made (Somewhat) Sensible.
=======================================================

Taking pictures or videos using a third-party app is fairly straightforward,
using `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` or `ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`. However, you as the
developer have little control over what happens with the image or video,
other than indicating where the result gets stored. Plus, different camera
apps have slightly different behavior, meaning that you are prone to getting
inconsistent results.

Taking pictures or videos using the built-in `Camera` class directly is
eminently possible, but is full of edge and corner cases, not to mention
its own set of per-device idiosyncracies. As a result, a ton of code is
required to successfully show a preview, take a picture, and take a video.

`CWAC-Camera` is an effort to standardize that "ton of code" and hide it
behind a scalable API. Here, "scalable" means "simple things are simple,
but complex things may be a bit complex".

In addition to what is written here,
JavaDocs [are also available](http://javadocs.commonsware.com/cwac/camera/index.html).

Library Objectives
------------------
The #1 objective of this library is maximum compatibility with hardware. As such,
this library will not be suitable for all use cases.

The targeted use case is an app that might otherwise have relied upon
`ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`, but needs greater reliablilty and somewhat greater
control (e.g., capture images directly to internal storage).

If you are trying to write "a camera app" &mdash; an app whose primary job is
to take pictures &mdash; this library may be unsuitable for you.

Installation
------------
If you are using Gradle, or otherwise can use AAR artifacts,
there are two such artifacts, mirroring the contents of the two project JARs:
one for native API Level 11 fragments, one for ActionBarSherlock.

To integrate the core AAR, the Gradle recipe is:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://repo.commonsware.com.s3.amazonaws.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.commonsware.cwac:camera:0.6.+'
}
```

To integrate the `-v9` AAR for ActionBarSherlock support, the
Gradle recipe is:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral();

    maven {
        url "https://repo.commonsware.com.s3.amazonaws.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile('com.commonsware.cwac:camera-v9:0.6.+') {
      exclude module: 'support-v4'
    }

    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.+'
}
```

(where you can choose your own version number for the `support-v4` dependency
as desired)

You are also welcome to clone this repo and use `camera/` and
`camera-v9/` as Android library projects in source form.

If you are using Eclipse, Ant, or otherwise need JAR files,
there are two JARs in
[the releases area of the repo](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera/releases):

- `cwac-camera-X.Y.Z.jar` represents the core classes, used in all environments
- `cwac-camera-v9-X.Y.Z.jar` adds support for ActionBarSherlock

(where `X.Y.Z` is the version number of the project, such as `0.6.10`)

**NOTE**: The JAR name, as of v0.6.8, has a `cwac-` prefix, to help distinguish
it from other JARs.

Users of the JARs will also want to copy the contents of
the `camera/res/xml/` directory into their project, as that directory
contains XML resources that help the library deal with device-specific
idiosyncrasies.

Note that the JAR format for this project will be discontinued when
the library reaches version 1.0. That will not be until mid-2014, but it
is something that you should keep in mind.

If you are upgrading a project using CWAC-Camera to a new edition of the
library, please see
[the "Upgrading" section below](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera#upgrading).

Basic Usage
-----------

Step #1: Install the JARs or AARs as described above.

Step #2: Add a `CameraFragment` to your UI. You have two versions of
`CameraFragment` to choose from:

- `com.commonsware.cwac.camera.CameraFragment` for use with native
API Level 11+ fragments

- `com.commonsware.cwac.camera.acl.CameraFragment` for use with
the Android Support package's backport of fragments and
[ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/), supporting API Level 9
and 10

(note: if you choose the latter, your project will also need
to have the ActionBarSherlock library project)

The `CameraFragment` is responsible for rendering your preview, so
you need to size and position it as desired.

Step #3: Call `takePicture()` on the `CameraFragment` when you want
to take a picture, which will be stored in the default digital photos
directory (e.g., `DCIM`) on external storage as `Photo_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.jpg`, where
`yyyyMMdd_HHmmss` is replaced by the current date and time. Note
that `takePicture()` can throw an `IllegalStateException` if you
call it before the preview is ready or if you call it while auto-focus
is occurring.

Step #3b: Call `startRecording()` and `stopRecording()` on the
`CameraFragment` to record a video. **NOTE** that this is presently
only available on `com.commonsware.cwac.camera.CameraFragment`
for use with native API Level 11+ fragments. The resulting video
will be stored in the default videos directory (e.g., `Movies`) on external storage as
 `Video_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.mp4`, where
`yyyyMMdd_HHmmss` is replaced by the current date and time.

Step #4: Add appropriate `<uses-permission>` elements to your manifest.
For what is described in the preceding steps, you would need the `CAMERA`,
`RECORD_AUDIO`, and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions. `RECORD_AUDIO`
is for the video recording using `startRecording()`; if you are only taking
still photos, you will not need that permission.

And that's it.

`CameraFragment` (and its underlying `CameraView`)
will handle:

- Showing the preview using an optimal preview frame size, and
managing the aspect ratio of the on-screen preview `View` so
that your previews do not appear stretched

- Dealing with configuration changes and screen rotation, so
your camera activity can work in portrait or landscape

- Following the appropriate recipes for taking still pictures
and videos, including choosing the largest-available image size
for the resolution

- Opening and closing the camera at the appropriate times, so
when you are in the foreground you have exclusive camera access,
but other apps will have access to the camera while your activity
is not in the foreground

- And more!

Simple Configuration and Usage
------------------------------
Of course, there are probably plenty of things that you will want to configure
about the process of taking photos and videos. There are many hooks in `CWAC-Camera`
to allow you to do just that.

Much of this configuration involves creating a custom `CameraHost`. `CameraHost`
is your primary interface with the `CWAC-Camera` classes for configuring
the behavior of the camera. `CameraHost` is an interface, one that you are
welcome to implement in full. Most times, though, you will be better served
extending `SimpleCameraHost`, the default implementation of `CameraHost`,
so that you can override only those methods where you want behavior different
from the default.

`SimpleCameraHost` also offers `SimpleCameraHost.Builder`
that you can use for some simple configuration, instead of creating a subclass
of `SimpleCameraHost` and overriding methods. Create an instance of the `Builder`
(passing in a `Context` to the constructor, such as your activity), call the
various builder-style setters for configuration, and call `build()` to get your
customized `SimpleCameraHost` instance.

You can pass your customized instance of `CameraHost`
to `setHost()` on your `CameraFragment`, to replace the default.
**Do this in `onCreate()` of a `CameraFragment` subclass** (or, if practical,
just after instantiating your fragment) to ensure that the
right `CameraHost` is used everywhere.

### PictureTransaction

The `takePicture()` method has a zero-argument version that just takes a picture.
It also has a one-argument version, where the argument is an instance of
`PictureTransaction`. This will allow you to configure details of this particular
picture to be taken. You can create a `PictureTransaction` using its constructor,
which takes an instance of your `CameraHost` as a parameter.

Various sections below will mention using builder-style setters on `PictureTransaction`
to control how a picture is taken.

`PictureTransaction` has a `tag(Object)` method that allow you to attach
arbitrary data to the transaction, without having to bother with a subclass. You can
retrieve that object later via the zero-argument `tag()` method.

### Controlling the Names and Locations of Output Files

There are a series of methods that you can override on `SimpleCameraHost`
to control where photos and videos
are stored once taken. These methods will be called for each `takePicture()`
or `startRecording()` call, so you can create customized results for each
distinct photo or video.

Specifically:

- Override `getPhotoFilename()` to return the base name of the file to use
to store the photo

- Override `getPhotoDirectory()` to return the name of the directory in which
to store the photo

- Override `getPhotoPath()` to return the complete `File` object pointing
to the desired file in the desired directory (the default implementation
combines the results of `getPhotoDirectory()` and `getPhotoFilename()`, so
overriding `getPhotoPath()` replaces all of that)

There are equivalent `getVideoFilename()`, `getVideoDirectory()`, and
`getVideoPath()` for controlling the output of the next video to be taken.

`SimpleCameraHost.Builder` offers `photoDirectory()` and `videoDirectory()`
setters, where you provide the `File` pointing to your desired directory.

By default, if you are using `SimpleCameraHost`, your image will be indexed
by the `MediaStore`. If you do not want this, override `scanSavedImage()`
to return `false` in your `SimpleCameraHost` subclass (or, call `scanSavedImage()`
and pass in a `boolean` to use by default). This is called on a
per-image basis.

### Controlling Which Camera is Used

If you override `useFrontFacingCamera()` on `SimpleCameraHost` to return
`true`, the front-facing camera will be used, instead of the default rear-facing
camera. You can also call `useFrontFacingCamera()` on your
`SimpleCameraHost.Builder`, passing in a `boolean`
default value to use.

Or, override `getDeviceId()` (available on `CameraHost`), and you can provide
the ID of the specific camera you want. This would involve your choosing an
available camera based on your own criteria. See the JavaDocs for Android's
`Camera` class, notably
[`getNumberOfCameras()`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#getNumberOfCameras())
and [`getCameraInfo()`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#getCameraInfo(int, android.hardware.Camera.CameraInfo))
for more. You can also call `deviceId()` on `SimpleCameraHost` to supply
the camera ID to use.

### Controlling FFC Mirror Correction

By default, the pictures taken from the front-facing camera are a mirror
image of what is shown on the preview. If you wish for the front-facing
camera photos to match the preview, override `mirrorFFC()` on your `CameraHost`
and have it
return `true`, and `CWAC-Camera` will reverse the image for you before
saving it. Or, call `mirrorFFC()` on your `SimpleCameraHost.Builder`, supplying a `boolean`
value to use as the default. Or, call `mirrorFFC()` on your `PictureTransaction`,
to control this for an individual picture.

### Handling Exceptions

There are some exceptions that are thrown by the `Camera` class (and kin, like
`MediaRecorder`). Those are passed to your host's `handleException()`
method. The default implementation displays a `Toast` and logs the message
to LogCat as an error, but you probably will want to replace that with
something else that integrates better with your UI.

### Supporting "Full-Bleed Preview"

The original default behavior of `CameraFragment` and `CameraView` was to show the entire
preview, as supplied by the underlying `Camera` API. Since the aspect ratio of
the preview frames may be different than the aspect ratio of the `CameraView`,
this results in a "letterbox" effect, where the background will show through on
one axis on the sides.

The new default behavior is to completely fill the `CameraView`, at the cost of
cropping off some of the actual preview frame, what is known as "full-bleed preview"
(stealing some terminology from the world of print media).

To control this behavior:

- Have your `CameraHost`
return `true` or `false` from `useFullBleedPreview()`

- Or, call `useFullBleedPreview()`
on your `SimpleCameraHost.Builder`, passing in a `boolean` value to use by default.

Note that the pictures and videos taken by this library are unaffected by
`useFullBleedPreview()`. Hence, if `useFullBleedPreview()` returns `true`, the
picture or video may contain additional content on the edges that was not
visible in the preview.

### Wrapping the Preview UI

From a UI standpoint, the `CameraFragment` solely handles the preview pane.
Presumably, you will need
more to your UI than this, such as buttons to allow users to take pictures or
record videos. You have two major options here:

1. You can put that UI as a peer to the `CameraFragment`, such as by having action
bar items, as the demo apps do.

2. You can subclass `CameraFragment` and override `onCreateView()`. Chain to the
superclass to get the `CameraFragment`'s own UI, then wrap that in your own
container with additional widgets, and return the combined UI from your `onCreateView()`.
You can see this in the main demo app, which adds a `SeekBar` or `VerticalSeekBar`
for zoom levels.

It is also possible to replace `onCreateView()` completely with your own
implementation, or otherwise use `CameraView` from a layout resource. This is
covered later in this document.

### Auto-Focus

You can call `autoFocus()` on `CameraFragment` or `CameraView` to trigger any
auto-focus behavior that you have configured via `setFocusMode()` on `Camera.Parameters`.
You can call
`cancelAutoFocus()` on `CameraFragment` or `CameraView` to ensure that auto-focus
mode has been canceled.

Note that auto-focus is only available in certain conditions, notably when
the preview mode is enabled. You can call `isAutoFocusAvailable()` on `CameraFragment`
or `CameraView` to determine if auto-focus is presently available for use. Calling
`autoFocus()` when auto-focus is not available will have no effect.

`CameraHost` implementations will need to implement an `onAutoFocus()` method, coming
from
[the `Camera.AutoFocusCallback` interface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.AutoFocusCallback.html)
that `CameraHost` extends.
`SimpleCameraHost` has a default implementation of `onAutoFocus()` that
plays a
device-standard sound upon completion (API Level 16+ only).

`CameraHost` implementations will also need `autoFocusAvailable()` and
`autoFocusUnavailable()` methods, to be notified when auto-focus is available or
not. This can be used to trigger whether action bar items are enabled, etc.
`SimpleCameraHost` has no-op implementations of these callbacks.

### Single-Shot Mode

By default, the result of taking a picture is to return the `CameraFragment`
to preview mode, ready to take the next picture. If, instead, you only need
the one picture, or you want to send the user to some other bit of UI first
and do not want preview to start up again right away, override
`useSingleShotMode()` in your `CameraHost` to return `true`. Or, call
`useSingleShotMode()` on your `SimpleCameraHost.Builder`, passing in a `boolean` to
use by default. Or, call `useSingleShotMode()` on your `PictureTransaction`,
to control this for an individual picture.

You will then
probably want to use your own `saveImage()` implementation in your
`CameraHost` to do whatever you want instead of restarting the preview.
For example, you could start another activity to do something with the
image. However, bear in mind that an `Intent` is limited to ~1MB, and so
passing an image to another activity via a `Intent` extra is likely to be
unreliable. You will need to do something else, such as (carefully) use a
static data member.

Preview mode will re-enable automatically after an `onPause()`/`onResume()`
cycle of your `CameraFragment`, or you can call `restartPreview()` on your
`CameraFragment` (or `CameraView`).

### Zoom Support

To zoom the camera, call `zoomTo()` on the `CameraView` or `CameraFragment`,
supplying the integer zoom level that you want. This level must be between
0 and what `Camera.Parameters` returns from `getMaxZoom()`. The
`adjustPreviewParameters()` callback method in your `CameraHost` is a good
time to get this value and configure your UI (e.g., `SeekBar`) to allow
the user to zoom the camera.

`zoomTo()` returns a `ZoomTransaction`. This has a series of builder-style
methods (a.k.a., a fluent interface) that allow you to configure the
transaction, where the methods return the transaction so you can chain on 
the next call. The configuration methods are:

- `onComplete()` to supply a `Runnable` to be executed when we have reached
the zoom level

- `onChange()` to supply a `Camera.OnZoomChangeListener` to be called as
we progress to the desired zoom level

Once configured, call `go()` to run the transaction.

If the camera supports smooth zoom, the zoom transaction will take a few
moments, and you can cancel the operation by calling `cancel()` on the
`ZoomTransaction`. If the camera does not support smooth zoom, the zoom
level is just immediately changed.

Note that your `OnZoomChangeListener` supplied to `onChange()` will be
called before the `onComplete()` `Runnable`, if you happen to supply both.

The main demo app adds a `SeekBar` and `VerticalSeekBar` to control zoom
levels, so you can see how this is used.

Note that some devices lie about their zoom capabilities. For example,
the Motorola RAZR i's front-facing camera apparently does not support
zoom, where `getMaxZoom()` still returns a positive value.
`doesZoomReallyWork()` on your `CameraFragment` or `CameraView` will
return `false` if zoom is known to be broken for the current camera
on the current device. In this case, do not zoom, or your code may
go "boom".

### Camera? #FAIL

If `getCameraId()` of your `CameraHost` returns a negative value, `CameraView`
will assume that there are no valid cameras (e.g., your app is running on a
game console). In addition to avoiding anything that tries to touch the camera,
your `CameraHost` will be called with `onCameraFail()`, where you will be
supplied with a `FailureReason` of `NO_CAMERAS_REPORTED`.

If anything else goes wrong when trying to open the camera (e.g., a device admin
policy has disabled the camera), your `onCameraFail()` method will be called
with a `FailureReason` of `UNKNOWN`.

While `SimpleCameraHost` has a trivial `onCameraFail()` implementation (just
logging to LogCat), you are strongly encouraged to override this and inform
your users of the problem.

### Fixing Up Images... And Your Heap

There are a few fixups that the library performs on your images, 
to provide consistent output. The biggest one is to rotate the image
to the proper orientation, rather than rely on EXIF headers, as not
all image viewers use those headers.

The problem is that these fixups take a lot of heap space. By default,
the library will always try to perform these fixups, and for a
high-resolution image on a low-memory device, an `OutOfMemoryError`
may result.

You have two means of managing this, and you are welcome to apply
one or both of them:

1. You can add `android:largeHeap="true"` to the `<application>`
element of your manifest. On API Level 11+ devices, you will get
more heap space, making it more likely that the fixup will
succeed. However, this will hurt the user, in that your app will
tend to kick other apps out of memory more quickly, which the user
may not appreciate.

2. Your `CameraHost` can return a value between `0.0f` and `1.0f`
from `maxPictureCleanupHeapUsage()`. The default implementation
on `SimpleCameraHost` returns `1.0f`, which says "the `byte[]`
of image data from the camera can be as big as our heap limit,
and we should still try to do the cleanup work". A value of `0.0f`
would indicate that the cleanup work should never be done, and
the images will be saved in their natural state. A value in
between represents a portion of the heap space; if the `byte[]`
is that size or smaller, go ahead and try to do the fixups. Note
that this determination is made on the compressed JPEG `byte[]`
length, not the size of the decoded `Bitmap`, and the JPEG may
be compressed ~90% compared to its uncompressed size.

Advanced Configuration
----------------------
In addition to the configuration hooks specified above, you can do more
to tailor how photos and videos are taken.

### Controlling Preview Sizes

Your `CameraHost` will be called with `getRecordingHint()`, to determine if the preview
should be optimized for possible video recording, or not (i.e., only still images will
be taken). You can return a `CameraHost.RecordingHint` enum: `STILL_ONLY`, `VIDEO_ONLY`,
or `ANY`.

Usually, your `CameraHost` will be called with `getPreviewSize()`, where you need to return
a valid `Camera.Size` indicating the desired size of the preview frames. `getPreviewSize()`
is passed:

- the display orientation, in degrees, with 0 indicating landscape, 90 indicating
portrait, etc.

- the available width and height for the preview

- the `Camera.Parameters` object, from which you can determine the valid preview sizes
by calling `getSupportedPreviewSizes()`

The `CameraUtils` class contains three static methods with stock algorithms for
choosing the preview size:

1. `getOptimalPreviewSize()` uses the algorithm found in the SDK camera sample app

2. `getBestAspectPreviewSize()` finds the preview size that most closely matches the
aspect ratio of our available space

3. `getBestAspectPreviewSize(double)` finds the preview size that offers the biggest
preview size that only differs from the desired aspect ratio by the supplied
`closeEnough` value (`closeEnough` of `0.0d` would give the same results as does
`getBestAspectPreviewSize()`)

`SimpleCameraHost` uses `getBestAspectPreviewSize()` for the default implementation
of `getPreviewSize()`. You can override `getPreviewSize()` and substitute in your
own selection algorithm. Just make sure that the returned size is one of the ones
returned by `getSupportedPreviewSizes()`.

If `getRecordingHint()` returns `ANY` or `VIDEO_ONLY`, though,
`CameraHost` supplies the preview
size via `getPreferredPreviewSizeForVideo()` instead of `getPreviewSize()`. If you
wish to use a different preview size for video, return it, otherwise return `null`
and we will use the results from `getPreviewSize()` instead. `getPreferredPreviewSizeForVideo()`
is passed a `Camera.Size` as a hint from the device for a value to use, instead of
anything you might get yourself from `Camera.Parameters` -- while using the hinted
value is probably a good idea (if it is not `null`), it is not required.

### Controlling Picture Sizes

Similarly, your `CameraHost` will be called with `getPictureSize()`, for you to return
the desired `Camera.Size` of the still images taken by the camera. You are simply passed the
`Camera.Parameters`, on which you can call `getSupportedPictureSizes()` to find out
the possible picture sizes that you can choose from.

The `CameraUtils` class has a pair of methods for simple algorithms for choosing a picture
size:

1. `getLargestPictureSize()` returns the `Camera.Size` that is the largest in area

2. `getSmallestPictureSize()` returns the `Camera.Size` that is the smallest in area

`SimpleCameraHost` uses `getLargestPictureSize()` for the default implementation
of `getPictureSize()`. You can override `getPictureSize()` and substitute in your
own selection algorithm. Just make sure that the returned size is one of the ones
returned by `getSupportedPictureSizes()`.

### Arbitrary Preview Configuration

When setting up the camera preview, your `CameraHost` will be called with
`adjustPreviewParameters()`, passing in a `Camera.Parameters`. Here, you can make
any desired adjustments to the camera preview, *except* the preview size (which you
should be handling in `getPreviewSize()`). `adjustPreviewParameters()` returns
the revised `Camera.Parameters`, where the stock implementation in 
`SimpleCameraHost` just returns the passed-in parameters unmodified.

### Arbitrary Photo Configuration

Shortly after you call `takePicture()` on your `CameraFragment`,
your `CameraHost` will be called with
`adjustPictureParameters()`, passing in a `Camera.Parameters`. Here, you can make
any desired adjustments to the parameters related to taking photos,
*except* the image size (which you
should be handling in `getPictureSize()`). `adjustPictureParameters()` returns
the revised `Camera.Parameters`, where the stock implementation in 
`SimpleCameraHost` just returns the passed-in parameters unmodified.

### Arbitrary Video Configuration

Shortly after you call `startRecording()`, your `CameraHost` will be called
with:

- `configureRecorderAudio()`

- `configureRecorderProfile()`

- `configureRecorderOutput()`

in that order. Here, you can help tailor the way videos get recorded.
Each of these is passed the ID of the camera being used for recording plus
the `MediaRecorder` instance that does the actual recording.

The stock `SimpleCameraHost` does the following:

- In `configureRecorderAudio()`, `SimpleCameraHost` calls
`setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.CAMCORDER)` on the `MediaRecorder`

- In `configureRecorderProfile()`, `SimpleCameraHost` calls
`setProfile(CamcorderProfile.get(cameraId, CamcorderProfile.QUALITY_HIGH))`
on the `MediaRecorder`

- In `configureRecorderOutput()`, `SimpleCameraHost` calls
`setOutputFile(getVideoPath().getAbsolutePath())` on the `MediaRecorder`
(where `getVideoPath()` was described earlier in this document)

While these are reasonable defaults, you are welcome to override these
implementations to do something else.

### Overriding Photo Saving

The default `SimpleCameraHost` logic for saving photos uses the `getPhotoPath()` 
and related methods discussed above. Actually saving the photo is done in
`saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])`, called on your `CameraHost`, where `SimpleCameraHost` has a
`saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])` implementation that writes the supplied `byte[]` out to the desired
location.

You are welcome to override `saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])` and do something else with the `byte[]`, 
such as send it over the Internet. `saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])` is called on a background thread,
so you do not have to do your own asynchronous work.

Another use for this is to find out when the saving is complete, so that you can
use the resulting image. Just override `saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])`, chain to the superclass
implementation, and when that returns, the image is ready for use.

There is also a `saveImage(PictureTransaction, Bitmap)` callback, giving you a decoded `Bitmap`
instead of a `byte[]`.

By default, `saveImage(PictureTransaction, byte[])` will be called, and not
`saveImage(PictureTransaction, Bitmap)`. To change this, call `needBitmap(boolean)`
and/or `needByteArray(boolean)` on your `PictureTransaction`, passing that
`PictureTransaction` to `takePicture()`.

Note that if you say that you need the `Bitmap`, you are
responsible for the `Bitmap` (e.g., calling `recycle()` on it) once it is handed
to your host.

### Controlling the Shutter Callback

You can subclass `PictureTransaction` and override `onShutter()` to
do something when the shutter is pressed.

Also,
your `CameraHost` implementation can return a `Camera.ShutterCallback` object
via `getShutterCallback()`,
which will be used in the underlying `takePicture()` call on the Android `Camera`,
giving you control to play a "shutter click" sound. `SimpleCameraHost` returns `null`
from `getShutterCallback()`, to give you the device default behavior.

### Detecting Faces

If you wish to use the face detection APIs available on API Level 14+, do the
following:

1. Have your `CameraHost` implementation also implement `Camera.FaceDetectionListener`.

2. Override `adjustPreviewParameters()` in your `CameraHost` and take that opportunity
to check the value of `getMaxNumDetectedFaces()`, a method on `Camera.Parameters`.
If that returns 0, face detection is not supported by the device. **NOTE**: a better
API for this may be added in the future.

3. Override `autoFocusAvailable()` in your `CameraHost`, and if face detection is
enabled, call `startFaceDetection()` on your `CameraFragment` or `CameraView`.
**NOTE**: a dedicated callback for this may be added in the future &mdash; this is
a stop-gap to allow this fix to go in a patch release

4. Similarly, override `autoFocusUnavailable()` in your `CameraHost` and, if face
detection is enabled, call `stopFaceDetection()` on your `CameraFragment` or `CameraView`.
**NOTE**: a dedicated callback for this may be added in the future.

Note that this capability was added to version 0.5.1 of this library. Also note
that, while you can safely call `startFaceDetection()` and `stopFaceDetection()`
regardless of API level, `getMaxNumDetectedFaces()` should only be called on API Level
14+ devices, or you will be hit with a `VerifyError` or the equivalent.

### Choosing a DeviceProfile

`CameraHost` exists to provide a hook for you to determine how your app
should handle taking pictures and videos. `DeviceProfile`, on the other hand,
provides information about how the *device* handles taking pictures and videos.
Different devices do slightly different things when working with the camera.
Sometimes this is based on API level, sometimes it is based on how the device
manufacturer tinkered with Android, and sometimes it is based on the underlying
camera hardware. `DeviceProfile` provides a place for the CWAC-Camera project
to isolate these differences.

`CameraHost` has a `getDeviceProfile()` method that should return an instance
of the `DeviceProfile` to use for the device that is running the app.
The implementation of `getDeviceProfile()` on `SimpleCameraHost`
calls the static `getInstance()` method on `DeviceProfile`, which chooses
a `DeviceProfile` based on internal heuristics. If you encounter problems
with certain devices, you can detect those in your `getDeviceProfile()` method
and return a `DeviceProfile` that addresses your needs, otherwise settling for
using the library's own choice of `DeviceProfile`.

Note that `SimpleCameraHost.Builder` also has a `deviceProfile()` setter method that
you can call, passing in a `DeviceProfile` that will be used as the default,
replacing the system default.

The stock `DeviceProfile` is largely driven by XML resources. These
resources' names are of the form `cwac_camera_profile_XXX_YYY`,
where `XXX` is the `Build.MANUFACTURER` and `YYY` is the `Build.MODEL`.
Both `Build.MANUFACTURER` and `BUILD.MODEL` are converted to lowercase
and have non-alphanumeric values converted to underscores, to ensure
that we wind up with a valid resource filename. Each of those
XML resource files has a `<deviceProfile>` root element, containing
child elements for different values that can be overridden:

- `<doesZoomActuallyWork>` (a boolean, `true` or `false`) overrides
the default zoom detection logic, with `false` meaning that the device
lies and zoom is not really supported

- `<maxPictureHeight>` (an integer) is the largest number of pixels
high to use for the camera picture; a `Camera.Size` taller than this
is ignored

- `<minPictureHeight>` (an integer) is the smallest number of pixels
high to use for the camera picture; a `Camera.Size` shorter than this
is ignored

- `<pictureDelay>` (an integer) is a time in milliseconds to delay
taking the picture after updating `Camera.Parameters` with the picture
settings, for devices that seem to reset themselves when the parameters
are updated, resulting in messed-up pictures

- `<portraitFFCFlipped>` (a boolean, `true` or `false`) indicates if
the image cleanup work needs to flip the image if it was taken in
portrait mode from the front-facing camera

- `<useDeviceOrientation>` (a boolean, `true` or `false`) indicates
if we should skip the `setRotation()` call on `Camera.Parameters`
due to a device bug, and instead should just use physical orientation
in the image cleanup phase to get the picture to turn out right

- `<useTextureView>` (a boolean, `true` or `false`) overrides the
default choice of whether to use a `SurfaceView` or a `TextureView`
for the preview, normally driven by API level

- `<recordingHint>` (`ANY`, `STILL_ONLY`, `VIDEO_ONLY`) indicates whether
we should use a specific type of preview and image capture, based upon
the intended use of the `Camera` (this exists solely to work around
some device bugs)

So long as the resource exists with the right filename, the
library should pick it up, so you can add ones in your app if needed.

### Working Directly with CameraView

If you wish to eschew fragments, you are welcome to work with `CameraView`
directly. To do this:

- Add it in Java code by calling its one-parameter constructor, taking
your `Activity` as a parameter. At the present time, `CameraView` does not
support being placed in a layout resource.

- Call `setHost()` on the `CameraView` as early as possible, to make sure
that the `CameraView` is working with the right `CameraHost` implementation.
Alternatively, override `getHost()` and return the right `CameraHost`
there.

- Forward the `onResume()` and `onPause()` lifecycle events from your
activity or fragment to the `CameraView`.

Otherwise, `CameraView` should work as a regular `View`... so long as you do
not try to use it in a layout resource.

### Using CameraView in a Layout Resource

If you want to use `CameraView` in a layout resource, you can, but your
activity will need to implement the `CameraHostProvider` interface. This has
one required method: `getCameraHost()`, which returns the `CameraHost` instance
to be used with the `CameraView`. You would implement this in lieu of calling
`setHost()` yourself.

If you want to take advantage of this and use your own layout in a `CameraFragment`
subclass, simply override `onCreateView()` and do what you want. The only
requirement, other than the `CameraHostProvider` mentioned above, is that
your `onCreateView()` needs to call the `setCameraView()` method, supplying
the `CameraView` instance to the superclass.

The `demo-layout/` directory contains a small sample project that demonstrates
this technique.

### Flash Modes

`CameraView`, as well as `CameraFragment`, has a `getFlashMode()` which
returns the flash mode from `Camera.Parameters`.

To adjust the flash mode, you can call `flashMode()` on your `PictureTransaction`
to specify a mode to apply when the picture is taken. Or, call `setFlashMode()`
on `CameraView` or `CameraFragment` when needed. Or,
you can manually configure the `Camera.Parameters` object in `adjustPictureParameters()`
and/or `adjustPreviewParameters()`.

The `CameraUtils` class has a `findBestFlashModeMatch()` method that
takes a `Camera.Parameters` object, plus one or more `String` names
of flash modes (e.g., `Camera.Parameters.FLASH_MODE_ON`), and returns
the mode that appears first in your list of strings that is supported
by the current camera.

Third-Party Code
----------------
kenyee has
[an implementation of `CameraFragment`](https://github.com/kenyee/cwac-camera/blob/master/library/src/com/commonsware/cwac/camera/asl/CameraFragment.java)
that simply extends from the
Android Support package's backport of fragments, for use with the AppCompat
backport of the action bar.

Known Limitations
-----------------
These are above and beyond [the bugs filed for this project](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera/issues):

1. Taking videos in portrait mode is not supported.

2. While a picture or video is being taken, on some devices, the aspect
ratio of the preview gets messed up. The aspect ratio is corrected by `CWAC-Camera`
once the picture or video is completed, but more work is needed to try to prevent
this in the first place, or at least mask it a bit better for photos.

3. The Samsung Galaxy Ace refuses to honor a portrait preview in an activity
that itself supports portrait or landscape. If you lock your activity to only
display in landscape, the Galaxy Ace will probably work.

Upgrading
---------
If you are moving from an older to a newer edition of CWAC-Camera, here are some
upgrade notes which may help.

### From 0.5.x to 0.6.0 and Higher

If you implemented `CameraHost` or extended `SimpleCameraHost`, note that four
callback methods now receive a `PictureTransaction` as the first parameter:

- `adjustPictureParameters(PictureTransaction xact, Camera.Parameters parameters)`
- `getPictureSize(PictureTransaction xact, Camera.Parameters parameters)`
- `saveImage(PictureTransaction xact, Bitmap bitmap)`
- `saveImage(PictureTransaction xact, byte[] image)`

Conversely, all of the old EXIF-related behaviors are now gone. If
you created custom `DeviceProfiles`, they will need to be adjusted
to remove the `encodesRotationToExif()` and `rotateBasedOnExif()`
methods. Also, any custom `CameraHost` implementation will need to
have its `rotateBasedOnExif()` method removed.

If you implemented your own `DeviceProfile` classes, note that they might
now be able to be replaced by XML resources instead.

Taking pictures now involves a `PictureTransaction`, though the existing
`takePicture()` methods are still supported.

Also note that full-bleed previews are now the default, though you can
override that to revert back to the original behavior if desired.

### From 0.4.x to 0.5.0 and Higher

`CameraHost` used to have `mayUseForVideo()`, returning a boolean. That is
now `getRecordingHint()`, returning a `CameraHost.RecordingHint` value: `STILL_ONLY`,
`VIDEO_ONLY`, or `ANY`. `SimpleCameraHost` was modified to return `ANY`, so the
default behavior should be the same as before. Hence, you should only need to worry
about this if you overrode `mayUseForVideo()` or implemented your own `CameraHost`.

`CameraHost` now has an `onCameraFail()` method that takes a `FailureReason`
parameter. `FailureReason` is an `enum`, with values of `NO_CAMERAS_REPORTED`
and `UNKNOWN` at present. This will be called if `CameraView` could not access
a camera. `SimpleCameraHost` has an implementation of `onCameraFail()` that
just logs a message to LogCat, but you are encouraged to supply your own
implementation that does something more.

### From 0.2.x/0.3.0 to 0.4.0 and Higher

`CameraHost` now requires implementers supply `mayUseForVideo()` (`true` if the
preview should be optimized for possible use in video recording) and
`getPreferredPreviewSizeForVideo()` (returns the preview size to use in case
`mayUseForVideo()` returns `true`). `SimpleCameraHost` provides stock implementations
of these, but if you created your own `CameraHost` from scratch, you will need
to add your own versions of these methods.

### From 0.1.x to 0.2.0 and Higher

`CameraHost` now extends `Camera.AutoFocusCallback`, requiring an implementation
of `onAutoFocus()`. `SimpleCameraHost` shows a basic implementation that, on
API Level 16+, plays the device-standard "hey! you're focused now!" sound.

### From 0.0.x to 0.1.0 and Higher

Developers moving from v0.0.x to v0.1.x should note that you now need to pass
a `Context` into the constructor of `SimpleCameraHost`. This can be any `Context`,
as `SimpleCameraHost` retrieves the `Application` singleton from it, so you do not
have to worry about memory leaks.

Dependencies
------------
This project depends on the Android Support package and ActionBarSherlock
at compile time, if you are using
the Android library project. It also depends on the Android Support package and
ActionBarSherlock at runtime
if you are using the `.acl` flavor of `CameraFragment`.

Version
-------
This is version v0.6.9 of this module, meaning it is coming along nicely.

Demo
----
In the `demo/` sub-project you will find a sample project demonstrating the use
of `CameraFragment` for the native API Level 11 implementation of fragments. The
`demo-v9/` sub-project has a similar sample for the `CameraFragment` that works
with ActionBarSherlock. The `demo-layout/` sub-project demonstrates using
`CameraView` in your own layout resource, with the `CameraHostProvider`
interface and the `setCameraView()` call on the `CameraFragment`.
